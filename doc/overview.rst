Overview
--------

The SENTINEL partners work with a variety of models in diverse
computing environments.  The **SENTINEL archive** data format has been
chosen to facilitate interoperability between these diverse modeling
frameworks by making sharing of data easier.  Since we have to cope
with a variety of research requirements, and workflows, the format is
fairly flexible, and to a great extent self-descriptive.  We rely on
the authour of a dataset to also describe it.  A typical description
of a dataset includes both metadata and structural information.

Metadata typically consists of:

- a computer programme friendly name,
- a title and free-form descriptive text,
- search keywords,
- license information, and
- citation information.

Whereas structural information should describe the type information,
any contraints, and assumptions implicit in the data.  Our
implementation builds on top of the *frictionless datapackage*
specification.
